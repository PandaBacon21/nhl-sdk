# NHL SDK

This is a personal side/passion project for fun. I will do my best to update and continue working on this as time permits, but as a side project, I offer no guarantees on progress.

## Current State

This project is only possible due to the great work done by Zmalski creating the [NHL-API-References](https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference?tab=readme-ov-file#get-specific-player-info).

Full Postman Collection for testing [HERE](https://josh-personal.postman.co/workspace/My-Personal-Workspace~1a09e9af-597c-4eb3-806e-860262a49125/collection/19505270-dfda07ab-2c76-4c1e-9682-296f91049732?action=share&creator=19505270&active-environment=19505270-97cd10c3-3bf7-4101-b0b2-569cd2507fed).

Current state of this unofficial SDK creates mapping calls to all the NHL APIs for domain `api-web.nhle.com` up to the NHL Edge endpoints. Will continue adding the remaining mappings.

Currently working on the Players Namespace and Collections. Current structure provides access to Player Bio and Stats. Will be adding Player Edge stats next.
