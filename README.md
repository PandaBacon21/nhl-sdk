# NHL SDK

This is a personal passion project for fun. I will do my best to update and continue working on this as time permits, but as a side project, I offer no guarantees on progress.

## Current State

This project is only possible due to the great work done by Zmalski creating the [NHL-API-References](https://github.com/Zmalski/NHL-API-Reference?tab=readme-ov-file#get-specific-player-info).

Current state of the SDK creates mapping calls to all the NHL APIs for domain `api-web.nhle.com` up to the NHL Edge endpoints.

Currently working on Player and Team clients.
